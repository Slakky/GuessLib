# GuessLib - tool for library type inference

The analysis of publicly accessible RNA-seq data is becoming more and more popular in the field of bioinformatics. However, as the biological datasets are usually not curated, the metadata is not annotated properly.

One time-saving piece of information regarding RNA-seq is the library type, which is used to analyze the data
published by other researchers. We present GuessLib, an open access solution for library type determination created to fill in this missing metadata type. GuessLib was mainly developed in Django using an
in house algorithm for library type determination.
